# Overview

During my academic career, I published over 50 scientific papers (see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ZcQiAIMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)) in leading peer-reviewed scientific journals. In this project, I present the python codes I developed for the two papers [Phys. Rev. B 97, 094412 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.094412) and [Scientific Reports 9, 7197 (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-43702-9)
